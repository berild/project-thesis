# Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation

Project Thesis code, Introducing a methodology to do inference about conditional latent gaussian models. 
The method combines the adaptive multiple importance sampling algorithm and the density approximation method, INLA. 
Our implementation is applied to a set of examples to highlight the effectiveness and precision of the AMIS with INLA methodology.

## Bivariate Linear Regression

## Bayesian Lasso Regression

## Missing Covariates

## Spatial Econometric Model

## Classification

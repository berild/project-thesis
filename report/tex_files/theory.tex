\label{chap:inla}


The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation henceforth referred to as INLA, is fully described in \cite{rue_approximate_2009}.
This technique provides a way to approximate posterior marginals of the model parameters, given a model that is
Guassian latent. 


Given $n$ observation $\vect{y} = (y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)$ assumed to have a distribution in the exponential family, 
the covariates and a linear predictor can be linked to the mean $\vect{\mu}$ of the observation $\vect{y}$
through a link function.
